I met this lady in the condo, who said her profile name on instagram was silent car. How silent? I asked; very! she replied.
i starred at her for a while, admiring the spare parts and the body work; would you like to take a test drive?
She asked braking the silence. I looked deep into her eye; I´m alegic to noise I said; I have to be sure it is indeed silent.
It´s truely silent she confirmed in a cool voice.
